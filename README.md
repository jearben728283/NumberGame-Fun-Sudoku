# NumberGame-Fun-Sudoku

Sudoku is a logic game that uses paper and pen to perform calculations. The player needs to infer all the remaining spaces based on the known numbers on the 9Ã—9 disk, and to satisfy the numbers in each row, column, and every bold line in the palace, they contain 1-9 and do not repeat. Sudoku is a 9th house and each house is divided into 9 smaller rooms. In this eighty-one grid, given a certain number of known numbers and conditions for solving problems, use logic and reasoning to fill in the numbers 1-9 in other spaces. So that each number of 1-9 appears only once in each row, column, and house, so it is also called "Nine-square."
